React (Next.js) E-commerce Product Listing Page with Server Side Rendering
Objective: The goal of this coding challenge is to create an e-commerce product listing page using Next.js
and Tailwind CSS. The candidate should demonstrate their ability to work with React components,
manage state using Redux, interact with an API on the server-side, and implement SEO metadata.
Requirements:
1. Use the latest version of Next.js to create a new project. Set up Tailwind CSS for styling.
2. Fetch product data from the provided JSON API endpoint on the server side (you can use a
service like My JSON Server or JSONPlaceholder to host your JSON data). Each page should
contain SEO metadata.
3. The code should written in Typescript and should be Type saved.
3. Example data structure:

4. Create a product listing page that displays the fetched product data in a grid layout. Each
   product card should include:
   ○ Product image
   ○ Product name
   ○ Product description (truncate to 100 characters)
   ○ Price (formatted with currency)
   ○ Rating (display using stars or a numerical value)

5. Implement pagination or infinite scroll for the product listing. Limit the initial page to
   display
   only 10 products, and load more as the user interacts with the page.
6. Add a search bar to filter products by title. The search should be case-insensitive and update
   the product listing in real-time as the user types.
7. Implement sorting functionality for the products (e.g., by price or rating).
8. Add the ability to add products to a shopping cart and display the total number of items and the
   total price in a fixed header.
9. Set up Redux for state management.
10. Create a simple responsive design for the product listing page using Tailwind CSS.
11. Write clean, modular, and maintainable code.
12. Use Git for version control and provide a link to a GitHub repository with the completed
    project.

Bonus Points:

1. Write tests for the application using a testing library such as Jest and React Testing Library.
   Evaluation Criteria:

* Code quality and organization
* Proper use of React components and state management with Redux
* Server-side data fetching and handling SEO metadata
* Responsive design and user experience with Tailwind CSS
* Bonus features and overall functionality
  Submission:
  Submit the GitHub repository link, along with a short description of the implemented features and
  any
  known issues.
